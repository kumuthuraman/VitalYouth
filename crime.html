<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Juvenile Drug Arrests  </h2>
<img class="imgb"src="juvie.jpg" alt="Juvenile Inmate">
<p>Getting caught with drugs or alcohol when you’re underage is reason enough for a young person to face legal trouble. Possession, public intoxication and buying or selling substances is often how many teens first cross paths with law enforcement. Research shows that substance use increases a teen’s likelihood of a prolonged interaction with the juvenile justice system. The earlier a child begins abusing drugs or alcohol, the greater their probability of serious and persistent criminal behavior.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Effect Of A Criminal Record </h2>
<img class="imgc"src="arrest.jpg" alt="Teen Arrested">
<p>A juvenile record can appear on background checks long into a teen’s adult years. If arrested as an adult, these juvenile records can result in longer periods of incarceration. Court costs or legal fees associated with a teen can become a major plight for not only them but their family as well. This can send a teen into serious debt and possibly hurt their credit in the future by setting limitations. </p>
