Even though it's illegal for a person under the age of 21 to drink alcohol, their study have also found that people aged 12-20 consume about one-tenth of of all the alcohol comsumed in the U.S. Also about half of the 9th through 12th graders reported have tried marijuana. Lastly, about 4 out of 10 9th through 12th graders repoerted have tried cigarettes. But some other commonly used drugs among teen besides alcohol, marjuana, and tobacco are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cocaine </li>

  <p> Every state in the U.S. has its own opinion about drugs whether legal or illegal. Some states have a very high drug tolerance while some states have a very low drug tolerance. The states with higher drug tolerances are more likely to have higher numbers of both teen and adult drug addicts. Also within these high drug tolerant states more teens are being put at risk for becoming either a drug addict or a drug dealer.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> How It's Classified</h2>
<img class="img5" src="class.jpeg" alt="Classification">
<p> According to the DEA "drugs, substances, and certain chemicals used to make drugs are classified into five distinct categories or schedules depending upon the drug’s acceptable medical use and the drug’s abuse or dependency potential." Every drug has it's own catergory that it's classified under based upon abuse potential and its approved medcial use. Common drugs abused by teens like marijuana and alcohol would be classified as a Schedule I drug because of its high abuse potential.</p>
  Classification: <br>
  <ul>
<li>Schedule I - Highest Abuse Potential <br>
(Cannabis, Ecstasy, Heroin) </li><br>
<li>Schedule II - High Abuse Potential But Severe Dependency <br>
(Morphine, Methadone, Adderall) </li><br>
<li>Schedule III - Moderate Abuse Potential and Moderate Dependency <br>
(Anabolic steroids, Ketamine) </li><br>
<li>Schedule IV - Low Abuse Potential and Low Dependency <br>
(Valium, Xanax, Ambien) </li><br>
<li>Schedule V - Lowest Abuse Potential and Lowest Dependency <br>
(Cough syrups, Codeine, Ezogabine) </li>	</ul>	<br>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Variety Types</h2>
  <a target="_blank" href="types.jpg">
<img class="img6" src="types.jpg" alt="Types">
  </a>
  <p> When teens use drugs they don't realize the effect that drugs will have on not only them but the people around them. The physical and emotional strain is enough to break a person's trust and even a person's relationship. Each drug is its own type with short term and long term side effects.</p>
  Drug Types <br>
  <ul>
  <li>Stimulants <br>
  <p>Stimulants impact the body’s central nervous system, causing the user to feel as if they are “speeding up.” These drugs increase the user’s level of alertness, heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and blood glucose levels.</p>
 -Cocaine<br> 
 -Methamphetamine <br>
 -Adderall <br>
 -Ritalin  <br>
 -Ecstasy </li><br>

 <li> Depressants <br>
 <p>Depressants also impact the body’s central nervous system, but with the opposite effect of stimulants, making users feel as if things are “slowing down.” Thus, they are often called “downers”.</p>
  -Rohypnol<br>
  -Barbiturates <br>
  -Xanax<br>
  -Alcohol <br>
  -Tobacco</li><br>

  <li>Hallucinogens <br>
  <p>Hallucinogens work by disrupting communication within the brain. Users report intense, rapidly shifting emotions and perceptions of things that aren’t really there. For example the user will feel as though they're talking to somebody who isn't really there.</p>
  -LSD <br>
  -Mescaline<br>
  -Mushrooms<br>
  -Peyote<br>
  -Salvia</li><br>

 <li> Dissociatives <br>
 <p>Dissociatives work by interfering with the brain’s receptors for the chemical glutamate, which plays a significant role in cognition, emotionality and pain perception. The user may gain a false sense of invincibility, then engage in risky or potentially deadly behavior.</p>
  -Ketamines<br>
  -PCP <br>
  -Analogs <br>
  -Salvia <br>
  -DXM </li><br>

 <li> Opioids <br>
 <p> Opioids are powerful painkillers that produce a sense of euphoria in users. Opioids are often prescribed by doctors to patients who are suffering from intense pain. They are extremely habit-forming, sometimes even causing addiction in as little as three days.</p>
  -Heroin<br>
  -Opium<br>
  -Morphine<br>
  -Vicodin <br>
  -Oxycontin</li><br>

  <li>Cannabis <br>
  <p> Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States. Marijuana use has a wide range of health effects on the body and brain. People who are addicted to marijuana are also at a higher risk of negative consequences such as problems with attention, memory, and learning.</p>   
  -Marijuana <br>
  -Hashish <br>
  -Hash Oil <br>
  -Sativex </li><br>

 <li> Club Drugs <br>
 <p>Club drugs are group of psychoactive drugs. They act on the central nervous system and can cause changes in mood, awareness, and how you act. These drugs are often abused by young adults at all-night dance parties, dance clubs, and bars called "raves".</p> 
  -MDMA <br>
  -Rohypnol<br>
  -GHB </li><br>

  <li>Inhalants <br>
  <p> Inhalants are made mostly up of everyday household items, these drugs cause brief feelings of euphoria. Inhalants are always inhaled as gases or fumes. The “highs” slightly differ from inhalant to inhalant, but most abusers are willing to huff whatever they can acquire.</p>
  -Paint Thinner <br>
